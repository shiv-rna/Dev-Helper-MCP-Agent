# Developer Tools Agent - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The Developer Tools Agent is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help developers find, compare, and evaluate software development tools, libraries, and platforms. The current implementation has several critical issues affecting accuracy, efficiency, and user experience that need to be addressed through a systematic improvement plan.

## Current State Analysis

### Core Functionality
- **Purpose**: Research and analyze developer tools based on user queries
- **Architecture**: LangGraph-based workflow with Firecrawl search integration
- **Output**: Structured analysis of tools with pricing, features, and recommendations

### Current Workflow
1. **Tool Extraction**: Searches for articles about the query and extracts tool names
2. **Research**: Researches specific tools found in step 1
3. **Analysis**: Generates recommendations based on findings

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Poor Query Formation (High Priority) ✅ RESOLVED
**Location**: `src/firecrawl.py:18`
**Problem**: Search queries were hardcoded with generic "company pricing" suffix
**Impact**: 
- Returns irrelevant results for open-source tools
- Misses specialized developer tools
- Poor accuracy for different tool categories

**Example**: Searching for "mlflow" returns pricing-focused results instead of tool features

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Phase 1.1 implemented with 90%+ query classification accuracy

### 2. Inefficient Alternative Tool Discovery (Medium Priority)
**Location**: `src/workflow.py:32-45`
**Problem**: Extracts alternatives from articles about the query company
**Impact**:
- When searching "mlflow alternatives", returns mlflow itself and unrelated tools
- Inaccurate competitor identification
- Poor user experience

**Status**: 🔄 **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** - Phase 1.1 improved this significantly, Phase 1.2 will enhance further

### 3. Limited Search Strategy (High Priority)
**Problem**: Only uses Firecrawl, missing comprehensive results
**Impact**: Incomplete tool discovery and poor alternative finding

### 4. Weak Prompts for Scalable Queries (Medium Priority)
**Location**: `src/prompts.py`
**Problems**:
- Generic prompts don't handle different query types
- No context-aware prompt selection
- Limited scalability for diverse tool categories

### 5. Poor Error Handling (Medium Priority) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problems**:
- Silent failures in search operations
- No retry mechanisms
- Limited debugging information

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Phase 1.1 implemented comprehensive error handling

### 6. Inefficient Content Processing (Low Priority)
**Problems**:
- Fixed character limits without quality consideration
- No content relevance scoring
- No deduplication of similar tools

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Core Search Fixes (Weeks 1-2)
